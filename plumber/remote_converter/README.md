# rioweb + Agave

## what is?

`rioweb` is a bare-bones simple, web-based, interface to the
[rio](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rio) R package.

`Agave` is a Science-as-a-Service platform for the open science 
community.

## what does?

`rio` provides a unified framework for the many data input/output
routines available in the R community. `rioweb + Agave` exposes 
it on a web app, allowing you to browse and convert existing data on your remote
storage system between various file formats with a simple
download (converted) interface; no need to install any software, 
remember passwords, api keys, or create accounts. Agave handles your 
data and `rionweb + Agave` handles the conversion.
